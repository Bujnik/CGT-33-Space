# CodeGymTasks

 CodeGym mini project - level 33 - Space
 
 This miniproject is about Space game, performed in console. 

__________________________________________________________
Task completed. My takeaways: <br>
-> Same as in task 32, easy and some code was already provided by CodeGym, so it felt like I didn't make this task alone <br>
-> Learned a bit about gitignore file, in particular, what it should have inside
